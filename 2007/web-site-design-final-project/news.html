	  <td id="right"><h1>PCs, 360s, PS3s getting Lost</h1><br /><br />
	    <h4>Producers of hit show <em>Lost</em> reveal that the game is in development for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.</h4>
	    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	    <div>
	      <div></div>
        </div>
	    <div>
          <p> As <em>Lost</em> heads into the  homestretch of its third season, the show is also venturing into new  territory--the realm of games. Last May, Ubisoft <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6151618.html">announced</a> that it was making a game based on the sci-fi drama and that the game  would be released in 2007 on unspecified consoles and handhelds as well  as the PC. </p>
	      <p> </p>
	      <div>  <img src="pics/lost.jpg" width="180" height="135" align="right" /><br />
	      </div>
	      <p>The publisher has been as quiet on details as Mr. Ecko was during  his vow of silence, but earlier this week a few nuggets of information  leaked courtesy of the show's producers, Damon Lindelof and Carlton  Cuse. </p>
	      <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
	      <p align="left">Speaking on their weekly <em>Lost</em> <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/podcast?pn=podcast" target="_blank">podcast</a>,  the two television execs answered a fan's e-mail regarding the game's  platforms. Lindelof confirmed that the game is headed to the Xbox 360,  and Cuse stated that it will also be on the PC and PlayStation 3. </p>
	      <p> The two didn't get into details, saying only that Ubisoft Montreal  showed them a &quot;very impressive&quot; demo of the game and that it would be  &quot;really cool,&quot; though &quot;not as cool as Galaga.&quot;</p>
	      <p>&nbsp; </p>
	      <p> Mobile game developer Gameloft has also taken advantage of the doomed  passengers of Flight 815. The company has released Lost The Mobile  Game, which features Jack as a playable character and a storyline  created by <em>Lost</em> writers. </p>

	  <td id="right"><h1>360 dashboard update detailed</h1><br /><h1>and demonstrated</h1><br  /><br  />
	    <h4>[UPDATE]  Fresh coat of features added to Microsoft's next-gen console; download  manager, dashboard startup, camera functionality among changes. Full  video demonstration inside!</h4>
	    <div>
	      <div></div>

          </div>
	      <p>Though  the Xbox 360 has only been on the market for just over six months, the  console is getting its first major facelift. Microsoft today announced  the first of what it hopes will be <img src="pics/dash.jpg" width="120" height="90" align="left" />biannual major updates to the  console's functions and user interface. </p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p>The Xbox 360 spring platform update does not have an official  release date yet, but Microsoft hopes to have it ready for download  over Xbox Live about a week from today. The update is the first  considerable change to the 360 since its launch in November 2005 and is  largely based on consumer feedback.</p>
	      <p>&nbsp; </p>
	      <p>[UPDATE] As shown in the extensive video demonstration below,  many of the changes focus on making things easier to find when  navigating the &quot;blades&quot; interface or downloading content on Xbox Live  Marketplace. A new Media and Entertainment category has been added to  the Marketplace menu, which features options to search for movie  trailers and short films, television promos, music videos, and others  instead of lumping them all together. </p>
	      <p> </p>
	      <div>
            <div>
              <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
              <h2>360 Update Demo--NEW!</h2>
            </div>
	        <div>
              <div>
                <div> <a href="javascript:videoplayerpop('6151956','','');"><img src="http://img.gamespot.com/gamespot/b.gif" /></a> </div>
              </div>
	          Microsoft takes you through the Xbox 360 dashboard's new features.            <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pages/gamespace/download_ini.php?pid=&amp;sid=6151956&amp;mode=previews">Download</a> </div>
          </div>
	      <p>The other Marketplace categories have also been revamped. For example,  game demos can be searched by genre, themes and gamer pictures have  their own section, and game videos (that is, trailers) have been  properly separated from movie trailers.          </p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p> While 360 users have adored the ability to download content onto their  machines, they've hated being pinned to the download screen, unable to  perform any other activities during the process. The new download  manager will allow up to six downloads to be queued up and prioritized,  freeing gamers to continue browsing, playing music, or get some gaming  in. Lag in online play shouldn't be a factor with background  downloading. Once an online session is initiated, all downloads will  pause, opening up bandwidth for the game. Once the player leaves the  online game, downloading will resume. </p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p> When a download is complete, the content can be immediately accessed or  applied. Just downloaded a trailer for BioShock? No need to navigate  back through the menus like before--just select &quot;play&quot; when the  notification comes up. Themes can also be instantly applied, rather  than sifting through one's personal settings. </p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p> Other updates to the various media functions of the 360 include fast  forward or rewind capabilities (up to 16x speed) in Marketplace videos,  improved data retrieval for names of CDs and individual tracks, and the  ability to resume playback on a DVD from where it was last stopped. </p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p>Sometimes, 360 owners just want to unwind with a game of  Geometry Wars Evolved or listen to some tunes, but when powering on the  machine, the game that was in the drive boots up. Not anymore. Gamers  will have the option of setting the 360's default startup to the  dashboard or whatever disc is in the drive. </p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p> The system's online functions will also have a few extras, as well. Now  when a gamer is idle, it will say so on players' friends lists. There  will also be an option to have separate gamer pics for friends and the  general public. Presumably, this is gearing up for the compatibility  with the Xbox 360 camera peripheral, which is supported by this update  even though it won't be released until this fall. Until then, gamers  can use available pics. </p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p>Though the update sounds like it will take up a large chunk of  space, it doesn't require a single byte on the hard drive. It actually  doesn't need a hard drive at all. The update is flashed to the 360's  internal hardware and won't be stored on the hard drive, making it  compatible with either SKU of the Xbox 360. It will initially be  available online and may be available on disc further down the road. </p>
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p> Microsoft is already at work on a fall update, which the company says will be even more robust and will include more features. </p>
