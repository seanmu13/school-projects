<br />
<p>My homework is best viewed in firefox 3 or ie 7.  It consists of 3 main php files: shop.php, store.php, and cart.php.</p>
<ul>
<li>shop.php - Main page for logins, user registration, forgot password, etc.</li>
<li>store.php - Page that shows the actual products and their information</li>
<li>cart.php - Handles everyhing having to deal with the shopping cart, including purchasing products</li>
</ul>
<p>I use style.css for some basic styling for my tables and fonts.  If an item has a negative quantity, I just
display it as 0 to avoid confusion and just say it is 'out of stock'.</p>
